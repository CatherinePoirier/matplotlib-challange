Based on the mean Tumor Volume fore each drug, Capomulin and Ramicane Regimens resulted in smaller tumor volumes while Stelasyn, Keapril and Naftisol Regimens resulted in the largest tumor volumnes. Both Capomulin and Ramicane also had the most measurements taken. Propriva had the fewest measurements taken while all of the other drug remigenms had about the same number of measurementstaken.

The male to female ratio of mice is pretty equal with 49% being female and 51% being male.
The tumor volume is smaller for mice with lower weights which implies heavier mice have larger tumors.
